PA-1-STK ovarian carcinoma vaccine is produced by transducing the ovarian cancer cell line, PA-1, with the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene, resulting in a cell line, PA-1-STK, that permanently expresses the HSV tk gene. Upon transfection into malignant cells, this vaccine is capable of sensitizing tumor cells in response to an antiviral drug such as ganciclovir, which is readily phosphorylated by the TK enzyme to its active form. Administration of ganciclovir following PA-1 STK transfection results in enhanced cytotoxicity of the transfected tumor cells. Additionally, adjacent non-transfected cells are also killed by the activated antiviral drug, a phenomenon referred to as the bystander effect that occurs with this type of suicide-gene transfer technique.",PubMed:7578411,,5245,VIOLIN: https://violinet.org/canvaxkb/vaccine_detail.php?c_vaccine_id=5245,https://github.com/vaccineontology/VO/issues/57,NCI: https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20Thesaurus&code=C2428,NCT: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00006216,Virginia He|Jimmy Guo|Jie Zheng|Oliver He,,,,

The RNA is translated and processed, and BCC-specific antigenic peptides are subsequently presented via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I molecules on the DCs surface. The MHC-presented peptides interact with and activate CD8-positive T-cells, which elicits a highly specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response against tumor cells expressing the patient-specific BCC TAAs. The signal cascade initiated by expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40L results in the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-12, which further stimulates CTLs. The vaccine can be used in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin which stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading, while the vaccine helps the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
