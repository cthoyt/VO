This gene has been used for vaccine development [PubMed: 10816475][PubMed: 11953393][PubMed: 12933826].    

MUTATION: An isogenic sodC mutant constructed from B abortus 2308 by gene replacement exhibited much greater susceptibility to killing by exogenous O(2)(-) than the parental 2308 strain, supporting a role for SodC in protecting this bacterium from O(2)(-) stress. The B abortus sodC mutant was much more sensitive to killing by cultured resident peritoneal macrophages from C57BL6J mice than 2308, and its attenuation in cultured murine macrophages was enhanced when these phagocytes were treated with gamma interferon. The attenuation of the B abortus sodC mutant in both resting and IFN-gamma-activated macrophages was alleviated in the presence of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin. Consistently, the B abortus sodC mutant also displayed significant attenuation in infected C57BL6J mice compared to the parental strain. These findings suggest that SodC protects B abortus 2308 from the respiratory burst of host macrophages [PubMed: 15845493]."
