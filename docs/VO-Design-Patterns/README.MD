# VO Design Patterns

This project focuses on standardizing various VO design patterns.

We can seperate the task to several sections:

- Vaccine classification 
  - vaccine classification based on disease
  - vaccine classification based on vaccine type
  - vaccine classification based on pathogen
  - vaccine classification based on vaccine component
  - vaccine classification based on vaccine function
    - preventative vaccine
    - therapeutic vaccine
  - vaccine classification based on vaccine mechanism 
  - vaccine classification based on status 
    - licensed vaccine
    - vaccine under clinical trial
  - vaccine classification based on host target (vaccinee)
    - human vaccine
    - veterinary vaccine
  - ...

- Vaccine formulation or component design patterns
  - vaccine antigen
  - vaccine adjuvant
  - vaccine recombinant vector 
  - ...

- Vaccine Host response design patterns 
  - Vaccine administration

What VO has for now:
- DNA vaccine
- RNA vaccine
- conjugate vaccine
- inactivated vaccine
- licensed vaccine
- live attenuated vaccine
- live virulent vaccine
- profertility vaccine
- prime-boost vaccine
- prophylactic vaccine
- recombinant vector vaccine
- subunit vaccine
- therapeutic vaccine
- multivalent vaccine
- toxoid vaccine
- whole organism vaccine
- combination vaccine
- marker vaccine
- edible vaccine
- contraceptive vaccine
- veterinary vaccine
- cocktail vaccine
- vaccine foreign to USA
- virus-like particle vaccine
- passive vaccine
- vaccine for disease
- vaccine for pathogen
- transmission blocking vaccine
