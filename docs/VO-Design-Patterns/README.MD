# VO Design Patterns

This project focuses on standardizing various VO design patterns.

We can seperate the task to several sections:
- Vaccine formulation or component design patterns
  - vaccine antigen
  - vaccine adjuvant
  - vaccine recombinant vector 
  - ...

- Vaccine Host response design patterns 
  - Vaccine administration
