# CVX-VO: The VO subset for CVX

With many vaccines developed and used, it is critical to standardize the vaccine information. The Vaccine Administered (CVX) is a product of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a reference ontology in the domain of vaccines. 

This project aims to map vaccine terms between CVX and VO, and apply such mappings for applications. We first generated a VO high level design pattern that maps and aligns with the CVX terms. We further developed an automatic mapping program. Manual evaluation and testing was performed. In the end, all the CVX terms were mapped to VO. A specific CVX-VO OWL file was developed and added to VO GitHub. Applications are being conducted.  

This is a collaborative project co-conducted by Dr. Oliver He's lab in the University of Michigan and Dr. Licong Cui's laboratory in UTHealth.
